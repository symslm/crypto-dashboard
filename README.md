# JavaScript-Crytpo-Dashboard

I have created A Dashboard using ApexCharts.js charting library. For Server I used Node.js and all the data which is being visualized is coming from Coingeko's API : https://www.coingecko.com/en/api.
Data related to Cryptocurrency Market is being visualized here. Its one of the greatest way to actually, analyze market data. Instead of JSON data I would prefer looking around a graph.
HAPPY LEARNING ðŸ’–
